        title: Our Principles
        content: >
          #### We are a movement to stop climate change and reclaim democracy


          *   We believe in a just transition for all.


          *   We recognize the need to restructure the broken system we live
          within.


          *   We believe in the power of direct action, while remaining
          non-violent in word and deed.


          *   We organize with an understanding that we live on stolen land,
          within a colonial system that needs to be dismantled.


          *   We stand with other movements for change, while grounding
          ourselves in our own story and purpose


          *   We will not give up, despite the fear and grief that we all feel
          in our day-to-day lives.


          #### We believe in equity and dignity for all


          *   We organize around the principle that each person is fundamentally
          equal.


          *   We recognize that we exist in structures which disproportionately
          harm marginalized communities.


          *   We organize with empathy and kindness.


          *   We hold space for many different stories to be heard, told by
          people from all different walks of life.


          #### We are open and accountable


          *   We accept all youth who choose to abide by our principles,
          regardless of experience.


          *   We openly and transparently communicate about roles and structure.


          *   We make decisions founded on democracy and collective need.


          *   We are accountable to tasks and to one another, recognizing that
          this requires us to be self-aware of our own capacities.


          #### We are a strong and supportive community


          *   We take care of ourselves, each other and our shared home.


          *   We work to cultivate strong relationships.


          *   We bring revolutionary joy to our organizing!


          *   We are conscious and vocal of our own needs, and the needs of
          those around us.


          *   We assume best intent and welcome different capacities.


          #### We are always trying to grow and improve


          *   We are continuously learning and educating ourselves about the
          world around us.


          *   We are open to trying new things and challenging ourselves, as
          individuals and as a collective.


          *   We recognize that we are part of an ever-changing world, and
          commit to re-evaluating and adapting in order to evolve our movement
          and ourselves.


          *   We understand that we will make mistakes and commit to learning
          from them.
